Our Cyber Threat Management Platform offers robust solutions for identifying and managing cyber threats through Reconnaissance, Profiling, and AI-Driven Phishing Simulations. The platform is designed to enhance an organization's security posture by simulating phishing attacks and profiling potential targets effectively.

**1. Reconnaissance and Campaign Management**
Goal: To streamline the reconnaissance process and provide efficient campaign management via an interactive dashboard, enabling users to gather and manage information about potential threats efficiently.

**Features:**

- Interactive Dashboard: The platform features a user-friendly dashboard with a login feature, allowing users to view all campaigns and records of past campaigns. The clean and intuitive interface makes it easy to navigate and manage campaigns.

**Campaign Management:**

New Campaigns: Users can create new campaigns by selecting a target domain name and choosing from a date-sorted drop-down list of campaigns.
View Campaigns: Users can access past campaigns by selecting a target domain name from a date-sorted drop-down list.
Automated Reconnaissance: Upon entering a target domain name, the platform automatically identifies active email addresses using techniques like Google Dorking, web crawling, and API integration with tools such as Hunter.io. These email addresses are validated and filtered to distinguish between active and inactive ones.
Manual CSV Upload: Users can manually upload a CSV file containing email addresses, which the platform cross-references with automatically gathered data to highlight new and unique addresses.
Deliverables: A comprehensive list of all active email addresses for each campaign.

**2. Profiling and Detailed Analytics**
Goal: To provide in-depth profiling of identified email addresses, allowing organizations to understand their targets better and tailor their security strategies accordingly.

**Features:**

- Parameter Identification: The platform defines ten key parameters for profiling, including age, gender, country, possible name, job title, social media profiles, interests, recent activities, affiliations, and contact numbers.

- Automated Profiling: Advanced tools automate the profiling process to gather data on the identified parameters, creating a comprehensive profile for each active email address.

- Manual Profiling: Users can manually input or correct data using an Excel sheet if the automated process misses certain information, ensuring accuracy and completeness.

- Deliverables: A detailed profile for each active email address, encompassing all the listed parameters.

**3. AI-Driven Phishing Simulations**
Goal: To enhance organizational preparedness against phishing attacks by generating realistic phishing emails and simulating user responses with AI-driven personas.

Features:

- AI Model Training: The platform collects a dataset of spam emails to train an AI model that can identify the characteristics of spam emails and generate convincing phishing emails.

- Phishing Email Creation: Using the trained model, the platform creates phishing emails that mimic the communication style of users within the target domain, including phishing links or attachments to test the simulation's effectiveness.

- Phishing Campaign Execution: An AI bot sends the generated phishing emails to the identified active email addresses, tracking and documenting the success of these campaigns by measuring metrics like email open rates and click rates on phishing links.

- Bot Communication and Validation: The platform develops AI personas that mimic real-life users. These bots respond to phishing emails, simulating human behavior. The platform evaluates the success of phishing attempts based on the bots' responses. If a phishing attempt fails, the platform generates new email content and retries the attempt until successful.

- This comprehensive platform offers organizations an effective way to identify and manage cyber threats, enhancing their overall security posture through advanced reconnaissance, detailed profiling, and realistic phishing simulations.
